  <h2>Texas Hold'em</h2>
  This is the most popular poker game in the world. If you want to learn to play online poker games, this is a great place to start.
This is especially true because most of the marquee tournaments worldwide (WSOP, WPT, EPT, etc.) use this variation.
The dealer will shuffle a standard 52-card deck (but will not play in casinos and card rooms). In home games, the dealer duties are generally shared among all the players at the table (shifting each hand in a clockwise direction).
In poker games with a dealer, a round disc, or a dealer button, moves clockwise each hand, marking which player would be dealer if the game was self-dealt.
Each player is dealt two hole cards with the goal of creating the best five-card hand possible. The action moves clockwise but starts to the left of the dealer button. The two players to the left of the dealer are generally required to post a small and big blind to start the betting and move into the rest of the action on the preflop, the flop, the turn and the river.
